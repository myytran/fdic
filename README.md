## Rules

### Filenames
* Lowercase only, no camelCase or CAPS, etc.
* Utilize hyphens instead of underscores if any

### Use relative URLs
Relative URLs must be used to refer to all products on the same server. Best Practice: href=”/directory/best-practice/list-path-from-root.html”> Bad Practice: href=”../../bad-practice-lookup.html”>

### All link URLs must be in lowercase in the HTML code
In the HTML code all links must be coded in lowercase (filename.html). Mixed-case (Filename.html) or uppercase (FILENAME.HTML) is not allowed. This applies to the entire URL in the  tag.

### Complete directory links
Links to URL directories shall end with /. For example, /news/news/press/2019/

### Alternative text
Format each image to include alternate text (alt text). At a minimum, the alt text for a meaningful image:
* Is 120 words or less
* Includes any words in the image
Decorative images should use a null value in alternate text, i.e., alt=“”, to indicate to assistive technologies that the images are not intended to convey any meaningful information.
